    "In this project, we aim to predict students’ academic performance based on their educational, social, familial, and economic backgrounds. The goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast students' final grades, enabling educators and policymakers to take proactive, data-driven interventions for academic improvement.\n",
